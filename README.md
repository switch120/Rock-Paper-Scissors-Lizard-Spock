# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
As Sheldon explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."

## Code Sample
This example of the slightly-more-compliated Rock Paper Scissors is intended to illustrate some foundational Web coding princples both in HTML and Javascript.

## Intended Audience
Beginner HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coders. Originally developed for beginning stages of Full Stack Web Development intensive bootcamp. Not intended for advanced audiences as some of the code presented is intentionally in less than optimal format to ephasize the more important pieces.

**Key principles:**
* JSON Objects
* Arrays of Objects
* HTML Event Hooking (user input)
* Dynamic HTML
* Advanced ES6 helper functions

## Technologies used
* Bootstrap - v4.3.1
* FontAwesome
* ES5/ES6
